        My name is Viktor Poszt, and I'm 29 years old. Currently, I live in Szeged with my girlfriend.

        In my childhood, I spent most of my time playing computer games. I was always amazed by how it's possible to move a character with arrows, navigate the computer with a mouse,
        create applications that can make people's lives easier and programming also allows us to develop robots that can assist doctors in healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wanting more for myself, I revisited my childhood dream of becoming a programmer.
        After discussions with my developer friend, who recognized my open-minded and agile mindset, I decided to enroll in the Codecool full-stack developer course online in February 2023.

        I consider myself to be a funny, communicative, open-minded, agile person, though I can be somewhat shy. When it comes to hobbies, I make it a point to engage in daily exercises to stay active.
        Additionally, my love for gaming is still very much alive!
